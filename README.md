# Predictive Threat Intelligence Platform for Cloud Vulnerabilities

This project aims to create a proactive threat intelligence platform for cloud environments that moves beyond reactive security approaches to predict emerging threats before they become widespread attacks.

## Project Vision

The modern cloud security landscape requires more than just reaction to known threats. This platform concept is designed to leverage machine learning and data analysis to identify patterns in threat data that could indicate emerging vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

Traditional threat platforms are primarily reactive, and this project explores approaches to shift that paradigm toward predictive capabilities.

## Conceptual Approach

The platform's design explores several key capabilities:

- Aggregating and normalizing data from diverse threat intelligence sources
- Using NLP techniques to extract insights from unstructured text in security advisories
- Applying time series analysis to identify trends in vulnerability disclosures and exploits
- Implementing machine learning to predict which vulnerabilities may be targeted

This approach would enable security teams to prioritize their efforts based on predicted threat likelihood rather than just historical data.

## Proposed Architecture

The platform design is built around these major components:

**Data Ingestion Layer**
A conceptual system for collecting data from various threat intelligence sources including open-source feeds (AlienVault OTX, VirusTotal), vendor security advisories, research publications, and security blogs.

**Data Processing Pipeline**
A design for normalizing and enriching raw intelligence data through a cloud-native pipeline into formats suitable for analysis.

**ML Analysis Engine**
The architectural concept for implementing various machine learning approaches:
- NLP processing to extract meaningful insights from unstructured text
- Time series analysis for identifying patterns in threat data
- Classification models for predicting vulnerability exploitation likelihood

**Visualization & Insights**
A dashboard concept for presenting predicted threats and recommended mitigations in an actionable format.

## Potential Technologies

The design considers modern cloud-native technologies:

- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure
- Cloud Storage for data lake capabilities
- BigQuery for data warehousing and analysis
- Vertex AI for machine learning capabilities
- Terraform for infrastructure as code
- Grafana for visualization dashboards

## Current State & Next Steps

This repository contains the architectural plans and design concepts for the platform. I'm working to implement proof-of-concept modules for the key components, starting with the data collection and processing pipeline.

This is an ongoing project meant to demonstrate cloud security concepts and explore the potential of AI/ML in predictive threat intelligence.

## Learning Goals

Through this project, I'm working to develop and demonstrate:

1. Cloud-native security architecture design
2. Data engineering for security intelligence
3. Applied machine learning for cybersecurity
4. Infrastructure as code for security systems
5. Effective visualization of complex security data

## Getting Started

The `/docs` folder contains detailed architectural diagrams and design documents that outline the platform concept. 

*Note: This is a portfolio project to showcase architectural thinking and cloud security concepts. Implementation is ongoing.*
