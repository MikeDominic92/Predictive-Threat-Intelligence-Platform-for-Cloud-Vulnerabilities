# Predictive Threat Intelligence Platform for Cloud Vulnerabilities

I'm excited to share this project with you, which aims to create a proactive threat intelligence platform for cloud environments. The goal is to move beyond reactive security approaches and predict emerging threats before they become widespread attacks.

## Project Vision

As I see it, the modern cloud security landscape requires more than just reaction to known threats. This platform concept is designed to leverage machine learning and data analysis to identify patterns in threat data that could indicate emerging vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

Traditional threat platforms are primarily reactive, and this project explores approaches to shift that paradigm toward predictive capabilities. I believe this is crucial for staying ahead of threats in today's fast-paced cloud environment.

## Conceptual Approach

The platform's design explores several key capabilities:

- Aggregating and normalizing data from diverse threat intelligence sources
- Using NLP techniques to extract insights from unstructured text in security advisories
- Applying time series analysis to identify trends in vulnerability disclosures and exploits
- Implementing machine learning to predict which vulnerabilities may be targeted

This approach would enable security teams to prioritize their efforts based on predicted threat likelihood rather than just historical data. I'm eager to see how this can improve security postures in cloud environments.

## Proposed Architecture

The platform design is built around these major components:

### Data Ingestion Layer
A conceptual system for collecting data from various threat intelligence sources including open-source feeds (AlienVault OTX, VirusTotal), vendor security advisories, research publications, and security blogs.

### Data Processing Pipeline
A design for normalizing and enriching raw intelligence data through a cloud-native pipeline into formats suitable for analysis.

### ML Analysis Engine
The architectural concept for implementing various machine learning approaches:
- NLP processing to extract meaningful insights from unstructured text
- Time series analysis for identifying patterns in threat data
- Classification models for predicting vulnerability exploitation likelihood

### Visualization & Insights
A dashboard concept for presenting predicted threats and recommended mitigations in an actionable format.

## Potential Technologies

The design considers modern cloud-native technologies:

- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure
- Cloud Storage for data lake capabilities
- BigQuery for data warehousing and analysis
- Vertex AI for machine learning capabilities
- Terraform for infrastructure as code
- Grafana for visualization dashboards

## Current State & Next Steps

This repository contains the architectural plans and design concepts for the platform. I'm working to implement proof-of-concept modules for the key components, starting with the data collection and processing pipeline.

This is an ongoing project meant to demonstrate cloud security concepts and explore the potential of AI/ML in predictive threat intelligence.

## Learning Goals

Through this project, I'm working to develop and demonstrate:

1. Cloud-native security architecture design
2. Data engineering for security intelligence
3. Applied machine learning for cybersecurity
4. Infrastructure as code for security systems
5. Effective visualization of complex security data

## Development & Testing

### Testing the Threat Normalizer

I've set up unit tests for the `threat_normalizer` function, which you can find in `src/functions/data_processing/threat_normalizer.py`. The goal of these tests is to make sure the data normalization logic works correctly for the different threat intelligence sources I'm using.

#### Setup

The tests are written using Python's standard `unittest` framework and the `unittest.mock` library. I'm using mocking to test the function in isolation, without needing to connect to real external services. Here's what I mock:

- **Google Cloud Storage (`google.cloud.storage.Client`):** This is mocked to simulate reading the raw data files, like AlienVault pulses or VirusTotal reports, and also to simulate writing the processed data files back to storage. This avoids needing a real GCS connection during tests.

- **Google BigQuery (`google.cloud.bigquery.Client`):** This is mocked so I can check that the function tries to insert the correctly structured normalized data into BigQuery, again without needing a live connection.

- **Datetime (`datetime.datetime`):** I mock this to get a consistent timestamp (for the `processed_at` field) in the tests, making it easier to check the output.

Inside the test file, `tests/test_threat_normalizer.py`, I've included sample JSON data that looks like the typical input we would get from AlienVault and VirusTotal.

#### Running the Tests

To run these tests yourself, open a terminal, go to the main project directory (`predictive-threat-intelligence`), and run this command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

#### Current Results

When you run the tests, you'll see output that looks something like this:

```text
ss...
Running test_normalize_threat_data_alienvault_success...

test_normalize_threat_data_virustotal_success finished.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 5 tests in 0.004s

OK (skipped=2)
```

#### Interpretation

The `OK` status at the end tells us that the tests I wrote passed all their checks.

The print messages show the steps the function took during the test, like processing indicators and trying to write data using the mocked clients. That "Errors inserting rows..." message is normal in this test setup; it just shows the mocked BigQuery client was called, which is what I want to verify. My tests confirm it was called with the correct data.

The summary line "Ran 5 tests ... OK (skipped=2)" indicates that out of 5 discovered tests, 3 ran successfully and 2 were skipped. I've added new tests for error handling scenarios:

- **Missing Input Files:** Tests handling when the input GCS file doesn't exist.
- **Invalid JSON:** Ensures the function handles files containing malformed JSON gracefully.
- **Missing Fields:** Validates behavior when input JSON is valid but lacks expected fields.

### Investigation of Skipped Tests

When I ran `python -m unittest discover tests`, the output consistently reported `OK (skipped=2)`. I was curious about which tests were being skipped and why, so I did a bit of digging:

1. **Initial Check:** First, I looked through the `tests/test_threat_normalizer.py` file to see if there were any `@unittest.skip` decorators in the tests I'd written. There weren't any, so the skipped tests had to be somewhere else.

2. **Verbose Execution:** I ran the test discovery with the verbose flag (`python -m unittest discover -v tests`) to get more details.

3. **Identification:** The verbose output showed the skipped tests as `test_collect_from_alienvault_live` and `test_collect_from_virustotal_live`, both located in `tests/test_osint_collector.py`.

4. **Reason:** The skip messages indicated these are "Live API test, requires credentials and network."

Mystery solved! The two skipped tests are related to the OSINT data collection module, not the normalization module I was working on. They're intentionally skipped during standard unit testing since they require live API credentials and network access. This is standard practice to ensure unit tests remain fast and isolated. So the `skipped=2` message is expected behavior for this test suite, not a problem with my code.
