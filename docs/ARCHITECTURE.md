# Architecture Overview

The Predictive Threat Intelligence Platform uses a modular, event-driven architecture to provide scalable, real-time threat prediction capabilities.

## System Components

### Data Ingestion Layer
I designed this layer with specialized collectors for each data source type:

- **Open Source Feed Collector**: Handles structured feeds like AlienVault OTX and VirusTotal
- **Web Scraper**: Extracts intelligence from security blogs and forums
- **Vendor Advisory Parser**: Processes formatted advisories from major cloud providers
- **Research Publication Analyzer**: Extracts key findings from academic and industry research

Each collector runs as an independent Cloud Function triggered on a schedule, with fault isolation ensuring that failure in one collector doesn't impact others.

### Data Lake & Processing Layer
The raw intelligence flows into a multi-tiered data lake:

1. **Raw Zone**: Immutable storage of original data in Cloud Storage
2. **Enrichment Zone**: Data enhanced with context, entity extraction, and cross-references
3. **Curated Zone**: Fully normalized data in BigQuery optimized for analysis

The processing pipeline uses Dataflow to handle both batch and streaming workloads, with custom transforms for intelligence normalization.

### ML Prediction Engine
This is the system's core, with three specialized model types:

- **NLP Components**: Custom-trained models for entity recognition, relationship extraction, and intent analysis from unstructured text
- **Time Series Engine**: Forecasts threat trajectories using historical patterns and seasonal analysis
- **Vulnerability Prediction**: Classifies which vulnerabilities are most likely to be exploited based on multiple factors

All models are deployed as endpoints in Vertex AI with automated retraining pipelines to adapt to evolving threats.

### API & Integration Layer
RESTful APIs allow secure consumption of intelligence by:

- Security automation systems
- SIEM platforms
- Incident response workflows
- Existing vulnerability management tools

## Data Flow

1. Collectors ingest raw threat data from sources → Cloud Storage
2. Cloud Functions trigger normalization pipeline → Dataflow
3. Normalized data stored in BigQuery for analysis
4. ML models process the data for predictions → Vertex AI
5. Predictions and insights flow to dashboards and APIs

## Scaling Considerations

The architecture handles scale in three key dimensions:

- **Data Volume**: Partitioned storage and distributed processing
- **Source Diversity**: Modular collectors that can be added without system changes
- **Processing Complexity**: ML model serving with auto-scaling

## Security Controls

- End-to-end encryption for all data
- IAM with least privilege access
- Secrets management for API credentials
- Comprehensive audit logging
